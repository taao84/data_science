Once you've written the code to answer a specific question, you can run the code by clicking inside the cell (box with code in it) with the code you want to run and then hit CTRL + ENTER (CMD + ENTER on a Mac). You can also click in a cell and then click on the right \"play\" arrow to the left of the code.

    "Character encodings are specific sets of rules for mapping from raw binary byte strings (that look like this: 0110100001101001) to characters that make up human-readable text (like \"hi\"). There are many different encodings, and if you tried to read in text with a different encoding that the one it was originally written in, you ended up with scrambled text called \"mojibake\" (said like mo-gee-bah-kay). Here's an example of mojibake:\n",
    "\n",
    "æ–‡å—åŒ–ã??\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also end up with a \"unknown\" characters. There are what gets printed when there's no mapping between a particular byte and a character in the encoding you're using to read your byte string in and they look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "����������\n",
    "\n",
    "Character encoding mismatches are less common today than they used to be, but it's definitely still a problem. There are lots of different character encodings, but the main one you need to know is UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "> UTF-8 is **the** standard text encoding. All Python code is in UTF-8 and, ideally, all your data should be as well. It's when things aren't in UTF-8 that you run into trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was pretty hard to deal with encodings in Python 2, but thankfully in Python 3 it's a lot simpler. (Kaggle Kernels only use Python 3.) There are two main data types you'll encounter when working with text in Python 3. One is is the string, which is what text is by default."

First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also lets you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n",

    "If you have a file that's in UTF-8 but has just a couple of weird-looking characters in it, you can try out the [ftfy module](https://ftfy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) and see if it helps. "
